# swapping-of-no.s-without any-temporary-variable
Developed by shraddhatech16
In this code we are not using any temporary variable
Instead of that we have to just make equations which contains a&b
With the help of these three equations  i.e.
1.a=a+b ,b=a-b , & a=a-b we can run the program and swap the no.s
